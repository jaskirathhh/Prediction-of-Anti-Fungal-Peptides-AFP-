# Prediction-of-Anti-Fungal-Peptides-AFP-
Machine Learning approach for predicting AFP using amino acid composition and global descriptors


This contain three files, first file train.csv contain training data set, second file test.csv contain test data set and third file sample.csv contain sample submission

-train.csv : This file have three columns, first column contain ID (sequence number), second column contain label (-1 for negative and +1 for positive sample) and third column contain sequence of peptide in single letter code

-test.csv : This file have two columns, first column contain ID and second column contain peptide sequence

-sample.csv : This file contain sample submission file having two columns, first column have ID and second column contain predicted label.
